BIG BROTHER by Lionel Shriver

2013. Fourth Estate/Harper Collins. Paperback.

I've collected a lot of Lionel Shriver's novels over the years and
this is the second that I've read, after the famous "We Need to talk
about Kevin". This book shares some similarities with Kevin, a
hyper-intelligebt female narrator, married to Fletcher/Franklin,
independently wealthy thanks to a thriving business. Both books have
shattering twist endings as their climax.

The twist ending of Big Brother is superb. even though it makes
Pandora the most unreliable of narrators. Her intervention and brother
Edison's year of weight loss and "coming of size" party didn't happen
quite the way Pandora first told it. The reader has been sucked
in. The revelation is on page 360 of the book's 373 pages.

A little like viewers of "The Sixth Sense" debated whether they knew
the twist ending that Bruce Willis was dead throughout the film,
readers of Big Brother might consider whether they saw the twist
ending coming. I certainly didn't, it was a knockout for me. Days
after I'd finished the book, I kept turning back to page 360 to
re-live that twist again and again.

Lionel Shriver lost a brother to obesity and this book has a touching
dedication. "To Greg - who was unfailingly, omprobably glad for
anything good that ever happened to me, and in the face of whose
drastic, fantastic, astonishing life any fiction pales". I'll read a
third Shriver soon. She does demand concentration and knock her
readers around, her novels have never been easy reading.

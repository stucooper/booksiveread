MARK STEYN'S PASSING PARADE by Mark Steyn

2006. Stockade Books. Paperback.

Mark Steyn is my favourite politics writer and my favourite discovery
from my first period of reading The Spectator, right after September
11 2001. He's written a lot on Islam and demographics, indeed I was a
third of the way through one of his politics books, America Alone,
when it all got difficult and I changed to this book of obituaries and
appreciations instead.

This was certainly a "read in any order you like" book, I kept track
of each obituary I'd read by putting a pencilled X next to the entry
in the contents page after I'd finished reading it. I'm not sure what
I'll do if I re-read the book, perhaps circle each X on the contents
page after the first re-read.

For a long time I didn't know if Steyn was pronounced to rhyme with
"stain" or "Stein". His website is steynonline.com and that rhymes, so
it's the Stein pronunciation.

Aside from politics, Steyn has a lot of interest in musicals and swing
music and Frank Sinatra and many people from that era are represented
in these obituaries. He loves pussycats and once recorded an albun of
cat songs and also a jazz version of the James Bond Shirley Bassey
song Goldfinger!

This book was a magic $4 pickup at a Canberra booksale. I'm off to
Canberra for another booksale in just three days time; hopefully there
will be more magic books there.

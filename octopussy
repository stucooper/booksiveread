OCTOPUSSY AND THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS by Ian Fleming

(1966) 2012. Vintage Classics. Paperback.

My Ian Fleming James Bond reading project has now finished; right
before the end of 2025. I enjoyed the short stories in For Your Eyes
Only a lot; these final short stories were almost as good. Octopussy
is a good story where James Bond is sent to expose an English retiree
in Jamaica, who stole two bars of German gold at the end of World War
2. Property of a Lady is a fun Faberge egg story; elements of which
were used in the Roger Moore movie Octopussy; which had a story
written by the writer of the Flashman books, George MacDonald Fraser.

The Living Daylights is close to the cello-lady sniper plot of the
start of the Timothy Dalton movie; only the shootout happens between
East and West Berlin; about a year before a Checkpoint Charlie.

The final story, 007 in New York, is inconsequential and is little
more than a shopping list of luxury foods and goods that can be
purchased in New York, and an update on how the great Hotels have
changed since the 1950s.

My Vintage Classics edition wrongly said James Bond will return in For
Your Eyes Only; that story collection was much earlier and this is the
true end of the James Bond cycle.

JAMES BOND WILL NOT RETURN. YOU HAVE REACHED THE END OF JAMES BOND.
CONGRATULATIONS, NOW GO AND READ SOMETHING ELSE.

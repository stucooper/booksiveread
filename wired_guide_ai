WIRED GUIDE TO ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE by Matt Burgess

2021. Random House/Penguin. Paperback.

This is a short introduction to Artificial Intelligence. I read it
in two parts, over three months, it's not a long book at all but
for some reason (let me blame the exciting 2024 US Election) I gave
up all book reading for weeks until finishing this book.

There are at least Seven Wired Guides in this series

ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE how machine learning will shape the next decade
CRYPTO CURRENCY how digital money could transform finance
QUANTUM COMPUTING how it works and why it could change the world

I own these first three; the other four are:
GREEN ENERGY how to build a sustainable future
THE FUTURE OF FOOD how to feed the planet without destroying it
CLIMATE CHANGE how we can get to carbon zero
GENOMICS how genome sequencing will change our lives

I've got small ebooks from MIT covering some of these topics as well.

Anyhow this AI book is an easy read, the author being a WIRED editor
is quite a booster of new tech and perhaps doesn't pay much attention
to the downfalls of AI apart from the problems that the creators of AI
are monocultural white Silicon Valley geeks and minorities can suffer
from being afterthoughts of AI's creators. Can the decisions AI make
be trusted, especially when the programmers themselves don't really
understand and can't really explain the process? The genie is out of
the bottle and users of products and people in society are now at the
mercy of AI.

This slim book will be easy to re-read and I'll do so again within six
months.

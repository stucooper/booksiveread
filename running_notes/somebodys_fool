Third in Richard Russo's Sully "Fool" series:
Nobody's Fool
Everybody's Fool
Somebody's Fool

PART 1 Saturday

Inheritence pp 3-20
===================
North Bath is being subsumed by hated neighbour Shuyler Springs.
House values will increase but so will taxes. Peter Sullivan can't
escape from the area; despite college teaching jobs in Manhattan.
He inherits first his mother's house then Beryl People's/Sully's house.
He does handyman fixit jobs on the houses on weekends.

Owning it pp 21-37
==================
Police chief Doug Raymer has retired and lets girlfriend Clarice
take the chief of police position for Shuyler. He regrets his
move that they've taken a "timeout" on their relationship and they're
now living separately. His inner voice alter-ego, Dougie from Everybody's
Fool, hasn't been heard from for a long time. His therapy sessions
with Dr. Qadry don't seem to be getting him very far but at least are
mostly paid for by the Police department.

There's an amusing flashback to Nobody's Fool where he discharged his
firearm (p25). "You know my thoughts on arming morons", the judge said.
"If you arm one, you have to arm them all. Otherwise, it isn't even
good sport".

Raymer gets a call from his former Police Seargent Miller, a dead body
has been found in the abandoned Sans Souci estate.

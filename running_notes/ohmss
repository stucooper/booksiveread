On Her Majesty's Secret Service

11th James Bond title. Longest of the books (259 pages) and it took me
a while to start reading it for this simple fact. Penguin Modern Classic
shows a rather dull skiing picture.

Chapters 1-5
------------
We're back at Casino Royale. Bond is on holiday and working his way back
to the UK through France. He becomes attracted to Tracy, and in saving
her from a seaside drowning by suicide, gets kidnapped by the French
Mafia, the Union Corse. Marc-Ange Draco, the godfather of the
organisation, is Tracy's father. If Bond can marry Tracy and get her
out of her depression, Draco will pay him a dowry of a million pounds
in gold. Bond can't do anything for Tracy right now (despite having
half-written a resignation letter to M because he's doing boring jobs
at the moment) and asks Draco if he has any information on the
whereabouts of Blofeld. Draco says he's in Switzerland.

Chapters 6-10
-------------
Blofeld has written to the College of Arms in London wishing
to establish his right to be Monsieur le Comte Balthazar de Bleuville.
A plan is hatched where Bond will impersonate a representative of
the College of Arms, Scotsman Sir Hilary Bray, and will meet Blofeld
under the guise of investigating his hereditary claims. Bond swots
up on Heraldry and family descent. He travels to Zurich and is met
by Blofeld's secretary and flown high into the Swiss Alps to Blofeld's
Alpine retreat.

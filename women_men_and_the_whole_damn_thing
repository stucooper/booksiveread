WOMEN, MEN & THE WHOLE DAMN THING by David Leser

2019. Allen & Unwin. Paperback.

I picked this book up today as part of a book purge and thought "might
as well read it before throwing it out" and managed to read it in a
single day. I'll probably still donate it, but it was good to get it
read.

It's a book-length examination of the #MeToo movement amd toxic
masculinity. It's the Australian version of Grayson Perry's "The
Descent of Man", which Leser has read and cites approvingly.

The famous cases of #MeToo (Harvey Weinstein, Aziz Ansari, Louis C.K)
are well covered. Leser is a bit too much on the political left for my
liking, the context of Julia Gillard's misogyny speech defending the
loathsome Peter Slipper is forgotten and Donald Trump is a bogey
figure too many times.

The book grew out of a long magazine article for Sydney Morning
Herald's "Good Weekend" and I do enjoy books by journalists who keep
me turning the page (the other one I'm thinking of was Susan Wyndham's
Life in His Hands about Charlie Teo and pianist Aaron MacMillan).

I think most of the lessons of this book can be found in The Descent
of Man which is a shorter and easier read, but David Leser has written
an excellent book that captures the state of feminism and #MeToo from
a worldwide perspective in 2018.

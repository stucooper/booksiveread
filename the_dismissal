THE DISMISSAL by Paul Kelly and Troy Bramston

2015. Penguin/Viking. Hardback.

Paul Kelly is the authorative voice on the 1975 Dismissal of the
Whitlam Government and this is his third book on the subject.
I had the earlier two, I remember the second one had the exciting
words DRAMATIC NEW ACCOUNT on either the front or back cover.
This third book, co-written with Troy Bramston, one of my favourite
political writers in The Australian, will hopefully be the last word
on the subject. I've long since hoicked the earlier two books and I'm
happy to have finally read this book.

My favourite part of many books are the final pages, amd the final
chapters and Epilogue of The Dismissal: In the Queen's Name don't
disappoint. The CIA conspiracy is given the treatment it deserves and
the post-dismissal lives of the three principals are covered
succinctly.

It's coming up to the 50th anniversary of The Dismissal this year
(November 11th of course) but I doubt there will be much new
information and much to add to this definitive treatment.

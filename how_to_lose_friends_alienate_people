HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS & ALIENATE PEOPLE by Toby Young

2008 (2001) Abacus. Paperback

Toby Young is one of my favourite spectator columnists. I got this
book at a Salvo's in Woy Woy, of all places, where I felt determined
to buy a second-hand book even though the selection was pretty slim. I
was pleased to find this book and even happier to finally read it a
few years later. It's the story of Toby's adventires in New York,
Manhattan, at the publishing company Conde Nast; publishers of style
magazine Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.

Hoping to find the modern day equivalents of the legendary wits of the
Algonquin Round Table, Toby is soon disappointed by the well-behaved
American writers and editors; none of them heavy drinkers. The culture
diffreence from Fleet Street is substantial.

Young chose an excellent title for this book, and his second book is
equally well titled, "The Sound of No Hands Clapping", about his West
Coast LA adventures as How to Lose Friends is turned into a film
starting Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges (my paperback is a
movie tie-in edition with the film actors on the cover).

Toby's father wished he'd written a more serious book, but the serious
parts of the book mentioning income inequality and Alexis de
Toqueville are the parts of the book that I found grating. If the book
had all been memoir and Conde Nast magazine gossip and party gossip it
would have worked even better and been consistent.

I'll shelve this book in the "New Yorker" box; while Young worked for
a different magazine, I still consider it a fun insight from a Brit
about the goings on at Conde Nast.

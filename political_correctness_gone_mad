POLITICAL CORRECNESS GONE MAD? by Fry/Peterson/Dyson/Goldberg

2018. OneWorld. Paperback.

This slim volume is a transcript of a 2018 two-versus-two debate
in Canada with the topic "What you call political correctness, I call
progress". The left/woke speakers are Michelle Goldberg and Michael
Eric Dyson (I have some of his books on race) and the
right/traditional speakers are Jordan Peterson and Stephen Fry.

I quite like debate transcript books, one of my favourites is
"This is/is not the end of the book" by Umberto Eco and some
French philosopher. The Political Correctness debate can probably be
found on YouTube but I feel no great need to find it, the book was
enough for me.

Race baiter Michael Eric Dyson gets into an argument with Jordan
Peterson and they're talking race politics more than political
correctness; the part of PC they're arguing the most is affirmative
action policies in Universities. Stephen Fry and Michelle Goldberg
come across a lot better; Fry addressing cancel culture.

This slim paperback is a victim of the "printed books must be a
multiple of 16 pages" stipulation and inclues a full 11 blank pages at
the end, without which the book would've been almost too thin to
print. Nonetheless, I do enjoy printed debate transcripts and this one
was a decent few night's reading.

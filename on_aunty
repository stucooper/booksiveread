ON AUNTY by Jonathan Holmes

2020. Hachette Australia. Tiny Paperback.

This is a tiny book, neasuring just 11 centimetres across and 15
centimetres high. I read its 129 pages in a little over an hour, which
sounds like a fantastic reading pace until you remember how small each
page is. To give you an idea of it, I will reproduce, with
line-breaks, page 87, which is one of the denser pages of the
book. Holmes is saying that the ABC must stick to their ideal of
objectivity.

###########################################
For a public broadcaster, there is no other
legal or ethical choice. As for Paul Kelly's
assertion that the ABC's pretence to impar-
tiality is a 'hoax [that] becomes more and
more absurd', it's clear that only a minority
of Australians agree with him. The minor-
ity is vocal, passionate and probably beyond
appeasing.
  Yet it shouldn't be shrugged off, as too
nany inside the ABC do. It's the same minor-
ity, in essence, as that Liberal or conservative
'base' that wields so much influence in the
modern coalition. It is crucial that the ABC
makes these people. too, feel that somewhere
in its output, online or on air, there are places
where its views and concerns are heard, and
reflected, and, to the extent that the verifiable
facts allow, given validity.

I typed this page in just so I could have a record in this book review
of just how small each page is and how you don't get many words to a
page. But the one I chose shows a pretty good example of Holmes's way
of thinking in this book; he has an entitled moan about how the ABC
has lost government funding and how they aren't given enough budget to
undergo a successful digital transformation.

This slight book has a price tag of $16.99 on the back and I got it
second hand for $3 which is about the right price for it; it's
basically a feature-length essay on the ABC, as part of Hachette
Publishing's "On Series". There could be a few more books on the ABC
in this series because other authors mentioned as writers in this
series include

Sarah Ferguson
Stan Grant
Leigh Sales
Mark Scott

The Series was originally published by Melbourne Univeristy Press and
Hachette acquired it from them and republished some of the titles.

I don't like tiny books, they don't fit well into bookcases and I'll
re-gift "On Aunty" to Charles Cave, without regret. Better a "Penguin
Special" sized paperback than tiny books like these. Penguin
themselves had a dreadful 50th anniversary tiny series of great ideas
and excerpts from the Classics that I had no interest in looking at,
even with my love of all books Penguin.

The book was a useful insight into standard ABC thinking. Holmes is
very intelligent but comes across as spoiled and entitled. I hope the
ABC continues to be shaken up.

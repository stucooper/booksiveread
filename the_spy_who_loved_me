THE SPY WHO LOVED ME by Ian Fleming

(1962) 2002. Pengion Books. Paperback.

This is book 10 of 14 of the James Bond series, and is popularly
considered the worst of the series. Like Moonraker, the 1970s film The
Spy Who Loved Me had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the Ian
Fleming book, and indeed both Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me had
quick knock-off novelisations released for teenagers to read and
re-live the stories, akin to the Doctor Who novelisations, a Star Wars
novelisation and the book of E.T, from someone with the improbable
name of William Kotzwinkle!

It took me a long time to begin reading this in my James Bond
read-em-all project. I'd finished Thunderball in late February and
it's now mid-May. I dropped off reading altogether, then read some
other books that I knew would be enjoyable, then bit the bullet and
began Bond Number 10. I tried to go into it with very low expectations
and also to leave prejudices behind.

Once I began the book it was OK although it wasn't a 50 pages per
sitting read like most James Bonds, it was a 20 to 30 pages per
sitting effort. The book is well divided into three sections and it
was pretty easy to set a (small) milestone target for each reading
session and acheive it.

This book is written in first person from a woman's
perspective. Nowadays authors are criticised for cultural
appropriation, here Ian Fleming is guilty of gender appropriation, and
writing from a woman's point of view. In a few places our heroine
Vivienne Michel is saying that women are asking for it and they need a
strong cruel man to dominate them in sex.

After the overblown nuclear missiles world held to ransom world of
Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me exists on the smallest canvas of the
Bond novels. A young woman babysits a forest motel for the last few
days before the season closes, only to be attacked by two hoodlums
sent to burn down the premises for the purposes of Insurance
Fraud. Just when the lady is at risk of violation from the hoodlums,
James Bond arrives at the motel with a flat tyre and nowhere else to
stay. Bond and Viv thwart dispose of the hoodlums, with some
difficulty, and Bond has left in the morning with a note promising
that Viv will receive a reward from the Insurance assessors in showing
the burning was fraud, and also there was reward money on the head of
the hoodlums also.

A younger US policeman explains that Viv has been caught up in the
tough world of spies and criminals, cold-hearted, ruthless men. She's
much safer staying away from Bond in the future.

The following passage (page 148) won't escape the sensitivity
re-writers:
################################################################
  All women love semi-rape. They love to be taken. It was his
sweet brutality against my bruised body that had made his act
of love so piercingly wonderful. That and the coinciding of
nerves completely relaxd after the removal of tension and
danger, the warmth of gratitude, and a woman's natural feel-
ings for her hero. I had no regrets and no shame. There might
be many consequences for me-- not the least that I might now
be dissatisfied with other men. But whatever my troubles
were, he would never hear of them. I would not pursue him
and try to repeat what had happened between us. I would
stay away from him and leave him to go his own road where
there would be other women, countless other women, who
would probably give him as much physical pleasure as he had
had with me. I wouldn't care, or at least I told myself that I
wouldn't care, because none of them would ever own him--
own any larger piece of him than I now did. And for all my
life I would be grateful to him, for everything. And I would re-
member him for ever as my image of a man.

I'm reminded of the song "All I want to do is make love to you" by
Heart, which expresses similar sentiments just as tritely but from a
legitimate female perspective.

Since this book is written from a female standpoint, the excerpt
isn't even saying "they're all asking for it", it's saying "we're all
asking for it". Ian Fleming seems to be hating American hoodlums
as much as he did in Diamonds are Forever which is another weak entry
in the James Bond canon. Bond number 11, On Her Majesty's Secret
Service, should be a huge improvement on this.

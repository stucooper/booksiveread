THE DARK NET by Jamie Bartlett

2015. Windmill Books. Paperback.

This book is an excellent survey of the darker side of the Internet
from a UK perspective. The organisation of the book is first rate
and each chapter covers a different aspect of the murky underground
online world. I found Chapters 1, 3 and 5 the most interesting.

Chapter 1: Unmasking the Trolls

Early online history; usenet, 4chan, doxxing

Chapter 2: The Lone Wolf

Political extremists on the Internet. Some of the people
(eg Tommy Robinson) I don't consider too extreme and have
political sympathy with.

Chapter 3: Into Galt's Gulch

Bitcoin and associated technologies. Libertarians.
Cryptography and Cypherpunks.

Chapter 4: Three Clicks.

Tor and hidden services and their use for underage pornography.

Chapter 5: On the Road.

The Silk Road and drug buying on the Internet. Digital reputation
and buyer rating schemes. Escrow.

Chapter 6: Lights, Web-camera, Action

Webcam sex performers

Chapter 7: The Werther Effect

Suicide support/encouragement groups on the internet.
"The Sorrows of Young Werther", a Goethe novel made into an Opera (by Massenet
if I recall correctly) apparently triggered a wave of suicides after its
publication, see page 209 of The Dark Net for details.

Conclusion: Zoltan vs Zerzan

Artifical life after death. The Hive Mind.

Notes: 52 pages of notes; about one-sixth of the book.

April 2024: I'm considering a close re-read of this book, inspired by the
puerile need to find a remembered joke about fark.com or digg.com being
popular even though for the first year of its online existence all it
showed was a photo of a squirrel with huge testicles! Hopefully that joke
is in The Dark Net, but whether it is or not, this book will still reward
re-reading.

AMY WINEHOUSE THE BIOGRAPHY by Chas Newkey-Burden

2009/2011. John Blake Publishing. Paperback.

I found this book at the perfect time, as an Amy Winehouse biopic
"Back to Black" was just about to be released to the Australian
market. I resolved to read the book before I saw the film.

I didn't quite get there, I read half the book, saw the film, then
read the second half of the book. The book was written while Winehouse
was still alive, and a final postscript added on her death in 2011.

The book is well written and music awards shows are much more
important to pop artists than I'd previously thought.
Chas Newkey-Burden is very sympathetic to Winehouse and says several
times that complaining fans at bad concerts shouldn't complain because
Winehouse's decline had been well covered in the tabloids, so what
were the fans expecting at her concerts? If you go to a concert with
the hope that there might be some kind of breakdown by the performer,
you're getting what you want if the whole show goes belly-up.

Husband Blake Fiedler-Civil carries the blame for Winehouse's
downfall, either by supplying her with drugs or by being absent in
prison for Grievous Bodily Harm and unable to provide her with any
emotional support. Blake isn't a likeable person at all in this book,
but despite Newkey-Burden's efforts neither is Winehouse in the
end. People sad about Amy wasting her talent after two fantastic
albums have got it right.

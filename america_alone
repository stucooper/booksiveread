AMERICA ALONE by Mark Steyn

2006. Regnery Publishing. Hardback.

This is the second Mark Steyn book I've read this year, after Steyn's
entertaining obituary collection, Passing Parade. This is the first of
Steyn's Islamic trilogy: America Alone, Lights Out and After America.
It's depressing material but Steyn is such an enjoyable writer that
it's fun to read.

Falling birth-rates in Western countries and soaring birth-rates in
Muslim countries suggest a much more Islamic world in the future;
especially as Muslims from Africa move to Europe. Steyn shows
incidents of terrorism and appeasement in France, Germany and other
countries. Europe's generous pensions and other welfare suggest that
these countries will be unable to summon the will to stave off their
eventual collapse. It is America, alone, that might be able to stand
tall; although the title of Steyn's third book in this trilogy, After
America, suggests they might be going down the gurgler as well.

Mark Steyn likes to do audiobook readings of unusual novels from
1880-1930 such as Greenmantle, P.G Wodehouse and Arthur Conan
Doyle. He finishes America Alone with mention of Conan Doyle's book
The Tragedy of the Korosko; with Western tourists kidnapped in Egypt
by savage natives. Questions of the White Man's Burden and England's
role in being World Police are as important back then as for the USA
today.

Steyn makes a convincing argument that we have better and more pressing
things to worry about than Global Warming.

WASHED OUT BRIDGES AND OTHER DISASTERS by G.B. Trudeau
A Doonesbury Book.

1994. Andrews and McNeal. Paperback.

I've always been a Doonesbury fan. When I was quite young The
Australian Newspaper carried Doonesbury and I'd get a laugh out of one
in ten strips even though I knew nothing about the US or US Politics
at that time of my life. Perhaps my favouite was when Windows 95 came
out and the characters were trying to install it on their PC. The new
Windows OS was all-powerful in a series of three strips. "Its just
turned on the printer. It's printed out a complete list of its
demands. Give no quarter - hold it to its Box Specs!".

Anyhow I picked up five slim Doonesbury books for $1 each at a
Lifeline Sale, half price day.

Each book can be read and enjoyed inside of two hours. The books
are:

1989 GIVE THOSE NYMPHS SOME HOOTERS         (read) (reread)
1992 WHAT IS IT TINK, IS PAN IN TROUBLE?    (read)
1993 QUALITY TIME ON HIGHWAY 1              (read)
1994 WASHED OUT BRIDGES AND OTHER DISASTERS (read)
1995 DOONESBURY NATION

I'll read the others in chronological order and update this review
accordingly.

Give those nymphs some hooters
==============================
Mike becomes a Dad after his estranged wife gives birth on cable
TV. Short on money, they employ Zonker as a babysitter. Mike is forced
to take on a tobacco advertising client; dreaming of Mr Butts, while
his girlfriend paints two bathrooms on the Trump yacht. Tehran's
annual condemnation of authors and decadent Western art disappoints
this time around.

The presidency is handed over from Ronald Reagen to George H Bush who
seems decent but uninspiring. Aids isn't getting the attention that it
deserves. Are the Skull and Bones Club stealing skulls?

I accidentally re-read this book on a train trip so I'll try to read
fresh ones next time.

What is it Tink, is Pan in Trouble?
===================================

The title of this book is obscure. Zonker, kicked out of living with
Mike, has moved back in with his parents. His dad tries to tell him to
grow up and he evades this by trying to communicate with fairy
Tinkerbell: What is it Tink(erbell), is (Peter) Pan in Trouble?

There's a fair bit of Dan Quayle bashing in this book; it was sport
for many years in the USA. Not too much politics otherwise; much of
the book is the adventures of the Doonesbury characters themselves not
political commentary.

Quality time on Highway 1
=========================

A nice easy read and probably the least political of the Doonesbury
books. George Bush has an attack squad ready against Clinton while
Ross Perot goes on a 60-day media strike. This was the last of the
92-page Doonesbury books I've read and I think I'll garage them all
now and maybe even divest them later.

Washed Out Bridges and Other Disasters
======================================
This book covers the topics of Medicinal Marijuana, The
Bridges of Madison County, a Japanese student being shot dead on
Halloween Night in Louisiana, and the early days of the Clinton
administration, when everyone was pulling all-nighters.

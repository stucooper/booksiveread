WASHED OUT BRIDGES AND OTHER DISASTERS by G.B. Trudeau
A Doonesbury Book.

1994. Andrews and McNeal. Paperback.

I've always been a Doonesbury fan. When I was quite young The
Australian Newspaper carried Doonesbury and I'd get a laugh out of one
in ten strips even though I knew nothing about the US or US Politics
at that time of my life. Perhaps my favouite was when Windows 95 came
out and the characters were trying to install it on their PC. The new
Windows OS was all-powerful in a series of three strips. "Its just
turned on the printer. It's printed out a complete list of its
demands. Give no quarter - hold it to its Box Specs!".

Anyhow I picked up five slim Doonesbury books for $1 each at a
Lifeline Sale, half price day. The first I read, Washed Out Bridges
and other Disasters, covers the topics of Medicinal Marijuana, The
Bridges of Madison County, a Japanese student being shot dead on
Halloween Night in Louisiana, and the early days of the Clinton
administration, when everyone was pulling all-nighters.

Each book can be read and enjoyed inside of two hours. The books
are:

1989 GIVE THOSE NYMPHS SOME HOOTERS
1992 WHAT IS IT PINK, IS PAN IN TROUBLE?
1993 QUALITY TIME ON HIGHWAY 1
1994 WASHED OUT BRIDGES AND OTHER DISASTERS (read)
1995 DOONESBURY NATION

I'll read the others in chronological order and update this review
accordingly.

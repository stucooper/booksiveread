THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN by Ian Fleming

(1965) 2004. Penguin Books. Paperback.

Just before 2025 ends, I have finally finished my James Bond
read-a-thon; well the completed novels at least. What began in May
2023 with an adult reading of Casino Royale has come to an end in
December 2025. I could've read the cycle a lot quicker but of course I
wanted to read other books in the meantime and not just read all the
James Bond books consecutively.

I put this book down after three chapters then got enthused again and
read the whole thing start to finish in a few sessions over a few
days. I'd read it early in my twenties and the only thing I remember
was a shootout on a train. There's a bit more to the story than this;
there's another hoodlums meeting a-la Goldfinger; SMERSH and SPECTRE
are history and the Russians are now represented by the KGB. James
Bond books move with the times.

The assassination of M chapters at the start are a bit silly; the
rest of the book functions very well as Vintage James Bond. Fleming
might be getting a bit tired of James Bond and I don't find myself
wishing that he'd lived ten more years and extended the Bond novels by
another five or six. The novels are a satisfying canon and this book
works as a fitting end to the cycle. It's a better plot and more
consequential than You Only Live Twice.

The movie of Man with the Golden Gun is completely different to the
book. The second of the Roger Moore James Bonds, it is a response to
Bruce Lee Martial Arts movies. The only thing used from the book is
the rather strange feature of the villain Scaramanga having a third
nipple.

Anyhow it's good to have the James Bonds all finished (I'll knock off
the final short story collection Octopussy soon) and my next trip to
spy-land will be something grittier; Grahame Greene or John Le Carre.

JAMES BOND WON'T RETURN.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON FEVER by Matthew Hardy

2004. Random House. Paperback.

I threw a lot of books out to make house space in Flemington this year.
Some books were donated to Lifeline's Lindfield Scout Hall Depot,
when Covid and Optus drives allowed. Some were hoicked outright.
Others, when they seemed good and interesting, were given to Charles Cave.

Saturday Afternoon Fever was quickly read by Charles and on his
recommendation boomeranged back to me. Charles was right! This is a hugely
enjoyable growing up story from a St Kilda tragic fan, who also played
Aussie rules at low levels.

I'm a late convert to AFL and resent that I grew up with Rugby League
as my winter sport and only have AFL memories from my 20s onwards.
I feel almost gender dysphoria that I grew up in Newastle with Rugby League
instead of in Melbourne with AFL, where I sensed my heart truly belonged.
Luckily the Sydney AFL scene has improved and games can now be attended
almost every weekend of the winter.

A lot of my book reviews here at stucooper/booksiveread are AFL-related.
These books are quick and easy reads. I haven't read a full book for months
and I feel guilty about that. An AFL book is an enjoyable read and hopefully
a path back to more focussed reading.

St Kilda are the cellar dwellers of the VFL, perennial strugglers and
easybeats. They're the equivalent of South Sydney in the Rugby League,
without the history of ealirer successes. St Kilda's final appearances
are few and far between. But they bring hope and meaning to their
downtrodden supporters and Saturday Afternoon Fever shows exactly
what football meant to a suburban boy growing up.

I've been able, through this book, to vicariously experience growing
up in Melbourne as a passionate Australian Rules football fan.

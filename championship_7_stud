CHAMPIONSHIP 7 STUD by Linda Johnson, Tom McEvoy and Max Stern

1998/2010. Cardoza Publishing. Paperback.

Can a poker instruction book be read start-to-finish, like a novel?
This attractively presented (beautiful sky blue cover) book can be.
It's well divided into the three accepted versions to 7-Card Stud,
Hi-Lo Cash, Hi-Lo Tournaments, Razz Tournaments, Stud Hi Cash,
Stud Hi Tournaments and Tournaments in General.

I read this book in just a few days to prepare for a H.E.R.O.S
tournament tomorrow (Saturday 30 Nov at the Marconi Club). HEROS is HORSE
with the game order shuffled around a little bit so you don't get
the three stud games RSE in a row; it just mixes things around a bit
and seems to provide a little more variation just in doing that.

I've got a lot of respect for Tom McEvoy and T.J Cloutier as poker
authors and old-time poker legends. T.J sits this book out but McEvoy
is joined by other Stud champions. Each chapter has a different
primary author and a secondary commentator, so there's some good side
discussions from the commentator on what the principal author is
saying.

I used to own a book on probably just Stud High by a guy named
Ansell Adams but unfortunately I lost that book or accidentally tossed
it on the grounds that Holdem was all the rage and I'd never need to
learn Stud properly. Nowadays I'm much more interested in mixed games
and non-Holdem games.

Anyhow this is one of my favourite poker books and one of the few that
I've read start to finish. Apart from the US writers using the word
"aggressiveness" instead of just simply "aggression" I have no issues
with the writing. Here's hoping I do well in tomorrow's tournament,
I'll postscript this book review with my results.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE by Ian Fleming

(1957) 2004. Penguin Modern Classics. Paperback.

I read this book in only three days right after the disappointing
fourth James Bond book, Diamonds are Forever. I said From Russia
With Love would be a lot better and it delivered as expected.
This is a marvellous book, possibly the best Cold-War thriller.
The back cover copy from Penguin reminds me that this was one of
President Kennedy's favourite books, and he was to have many
intrigues of his own against Kruschev.

The movie (the second of the series) is outstandingly faithful to the
book, and finally Q gadgets are starting to appear, and James Bond is
saved by one of them in his final confrontation in the train. Bond
doesn't appear for the first third of the book, which shows three of
the principal Russian characters, their lives in the Soviet Union and
the paranoia of not being able to say what they really think. When
Bond finally makes his appearance, he's gone soft after a year with no
active service, and seems no match for the disciplined Russians.

Most of the action of this book (and indeed the faithful movie) takes
place in Istanbul, Turkey, the city in two continents; Europe and
Asia. There's a lot of colourful writing and a rather exciting fight
to the death between two gypsy women over an affair of passion. After
Turkey, the rest of the story takes place on that most romantic of
trains, the Orient Express, on a four day trip from Istanbul to Paris.

If I were to recommend just one James Bond book to a friend, it would
be this one. "Goldfinger" is probably more famous, but this book
teaches us more about the Russians and is more exotic with the Turkish
scenes.

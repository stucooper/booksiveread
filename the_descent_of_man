THE DESCENT OF MAN by Grayson Perry

Penguin 2016. Paperback.

I bought this book at a Canberra Lifeline Bookfair simply because
it was an Allen Lane/Creamy Penguin title. It was the first Creamy
Penguin from that booksale that I read and I'm confident that it'll
be the most important.

Toxic Masculinity, they call it. Perry, a sensitive woke cross-dressing
artist, picks apart Masculinity and the problems it causes women,
society and men themselves. He is a fine humorist and as early as page
Two he has a laugh-out-loud comparison:

"It is a newsroom cliche that masculinity is always somehow 'in
crisis', under threat from pollutants such as shifting gender roles,
but to me many aspects of masculinity seem such a blight on society
that to say it is 'in crisis' is like saying that racism was 'in
crisis' in civil-rights-era America".

Men are unthinkingly playing a role they're uncomfortable with,
policed by other men and what Perry calls "The Department of
Masculinity". They need to be vulnerable and to be able to show their
emotions.

A huge annoyance for me is that nowhere does Perry acknowledge the
original book of this title: The Descent of Man by Charles Darwin.
The Origin of Species is about Galapagos turtles and other animals,
it's in the Descent of Man that Darwin shows humans are descended from
The Apes. Men would never be the same after Darwin's Descent of Man,
and no man should be the same after reading Perry's Descent of Man.

Finally this book begins with the funniest epigram I've seen to start
a book. "The truth will set you free. But first it will piss you off"
- Gloria Steinem.

I'm lending this book out to a friend tonight, when I get it back I
think I'll give it a quick second reading.

                                        13th October 2023.
